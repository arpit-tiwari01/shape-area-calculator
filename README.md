## Description
Java Geometry Calculator is a simple command-line application that demonstrates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The application allows users to calculate the areas of different geometric shapes, including squares, rectangles, and circles, by providing their dimensions.

## Features
- Calculation of the area for squares, rectangles, and circles based on user-provided dimensions.
- Proper use of OOP concepts to achieve code modularity and reusability.
- Implementation of abstract classes for shared behavior and concrete subclasses for shape-specific calculations.
- Polymorphic method that handles different shapes interchangeably through a common interface.
